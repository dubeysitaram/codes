	// Since we are using the new keyword, we have to delete the heap memory allocated
	// But when we write the delete animal command, it will
	// only call the destructor of the base class, not of the derived class whose memory was allocated
	// This is because we have not made the destructor virtual
	// So even though makesound is decided at runtime due to virtual,
	// destructor is not virtual by default and is resolved at compile time
	// This will lead to only calling the destructor of the base class
	// and this is not good because what if we dynamically allocate some heap memory inside the derived
	// classâ€”that will lead to memory leakage
	// Hence, add the keyword `virtual` in front of the destructor of the base class also,
	// so that destruction of derived class objects happens properly via base class pointers

	delete animal;  // Important: Will only call derived destructor if base class destructor is virtual
